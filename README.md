the early stages of a game built mostly from scratch, using the lwjgl library, which is a light-wight game-library for java 
enabling access to openGL and openAl. I've also used some classes from the library Slick 2d, which is a gaming library wrapped
arround lwjgl. In this early onset of the game I've constructed my own gui. Game-mechanics such as pathfining and AI are yet to
be coded.
